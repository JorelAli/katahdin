Installation

    After compiling you can use the executables where they are or copy the
    whole directory to somewhere else such as /usr/katahdin.
    
    You MUST set the $KATAHDIN variable to include the Katahdin directory, the
    library subdirectory, and the installed Mono library directory (usually
    something like /usr/lib/mono/2.0).

Getting Started

    Check the demos/ and tests/ subdirectories.
